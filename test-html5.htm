    <p>
      So, you want to learn HTML 4.
      The first thing you need to know is that element usage is inconsistent.

        <h2>
         Dividing up your page
        </h2>
      </hgroup>
      <p>
        So your page is not just a mass of words, you need headings.
        You should insert them in-between logical sections of paragraphs.

       How do I deal with multiple-level headings?
      </h1>
      <p>
      Sometimes, you'll want a 'subheading' to your headings.
      Things like:
      </p><blockquote>
      Dr. Strangelove,
      Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
      </blockquote>
      For that, just use more than one heading level:
      <pre>    &lt;h1&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
      </pre>

    <h1>
      A guide to HTML5
    </h1>
    <p>
    This section really belongs in its own separate page.
    That's why I've used an
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;h1&gt;
    </pre>
      tag â€”
      the same as the top heading in this page.
    <p/>
    <section>
      <h1>
        Abandon your thinking about HTML 4!
      </h1>
      <p>
        That's really the most important advice you should take from here.
