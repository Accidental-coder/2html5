    <h2>Your guide to HTML 4</h2>
    
    <p>
      So, you want to learn HTML 4.
      The first thing you need to know is that element usage is inconsistent.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Using headings</h2>
    <h3>Dividing up your page</h3>
    
    <p>
      So your page is not just a mass of words, you need headings.
      You should insert them in-between logical sections of paragraphs.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How do I deal with multiple-level headings?</h2>
    
    <p>
      Sometimes, you'll want a 'subheading' to your headings.
      Things like:
      
      <blockquote>
        Dr. Strangelove,
        Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
      </blockquote>
      
      For that, just use more than one heading level:
      
      <pre>
        &lt;h1&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&lt;/h2&gt;
      </pre>
    </p>
    
    <h1>A guide to HTML5</h1>
    
    <p>
      This section really belongs in its own separate page.
      That's why I've used an <pre>&lt;h1&gt;</pre> tag &mdash;
      the same as the top heading in this page.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Abandon your thinking about HTML 4!</h2>
    
    <p>
      That's really the most important advice you should take from here.
